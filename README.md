Hey! ðŸ‘‹ I am a software engineering student at The Australian National University. I use this GitHub for any side-projects or hobby coding.
I have a GitLab for my school work like group projects. I sometimes post my school work here on GitHub for you to see. 
Feel free to message me or email me ðŸ“«, and visit my small personal website if you want to get to know more about me ðŸ‘€.
Let me know if you want to collaborate on a cool project!
